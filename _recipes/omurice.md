directions:
- Heat up a large pan. Add butter, sausage and garlic and stir for 1 minute until the garlic turns a little crispy.
- Add the green bell pepper, red bell pepper, celery, carrot, mushroom, and onion. Stir a few minutes until the onion turns a little translucent.
- Stir in ¼ teaspoon salt and the ½ teaspoon of black pepper.
- Add the rice, ketchup, and mix it well. Let it cook without stirring for a minute, so that the bottom of the rice gets a little crunchy. Stir it again.
- Add egg, fry
- Remove from the heat. Add small blocks of cheddar cheese and allow to melt.
