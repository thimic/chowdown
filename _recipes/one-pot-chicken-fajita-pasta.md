directions:
- Heat oil in a large pot over high heat
- Add chicken and cook until no pink is visible, about 5-6 minutes, then take the chicken out.

- Add the chicken back to the pot with salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder, stirring until evenly coated, about 30 seconds.
- Add the milk and the penne, stirring constantly to prevent any pasta from sticking.
