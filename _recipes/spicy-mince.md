directions:
- Chop onions and mushrooms into small pieces
- Saute onions on medium high heat until golden
- Add mince a little at a time and toss with onions
- When the mince is mostly cooked, add the mushrooms
- Reduce heat to medium and add the sour cream, tomato paste and minced garlic along with about half the water. Stir until well mixed.
- Add seasoning to taste. I usually add coupious amounts of fajita seasoning and only a few pinches of salt and pepper.
- If too dry, add the rest of the water. If too liquid, let the mince simmer for a while until the right consistency is reached.

ingredients:
- 1 medium size brown onion
- 200g mushrooms
- 500g beef mince
- 2 teaspoon sour cream
- 6 teaspoon tomato paste
- 2 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1/2 cup water
- Fajita seasoning
- Salt
- Pepper
